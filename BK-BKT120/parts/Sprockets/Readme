******FULL LIST OF INSTRUCTIONS FOUND AT THIS WEBSITE******

http://www.gearseds.com/files/design_draw_sprocket_5.pdf

(Note:Must do all calculations before hand, if any questions text me. This website has everything you need, however,
the formulas are given in inches. You must conver your answers to millimeters do to your sketch in mm)

Additional Information 

1) Formula for the Sprocket Thickness and chain specs found at : http://www.gizmology.net/sprockets.htm
2) Make sure to use every single decimal for your calculations. Approximating your calculations to only 2 decimal places
will have a huge impact and will give you errors or open loops.
3) It took me a long time to get used to the instructions. Text me if you do not understand them.
